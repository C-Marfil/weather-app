# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weather App + Pomodoro Tool 🍅

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**An exercise on React 🌞 🌧️**

### Objectives

This project is my first encounter with React. A simple weather App that allows you to fetch the upcoming forecast for any city in Great Britain. It will show you a general preview, and you can choose to recieve more detailed information on any specific day. To make it more functional, I added a special feature, but more about 🍅🍅🍅 below!
